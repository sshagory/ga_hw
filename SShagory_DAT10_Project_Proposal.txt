Since December 2008 the US Federal Reserve (and other developed world central banks) has 
maintained interest rates charges at essentially zero.  The purpose has been to reduce
the cost of borrowing, encourage household spending, and stimulate economic growth.  While
some additional economic activity has occurred, these emergency interest rate reductions 
have not created strong growth rates.

A school of thought has emerged which argues these zero based interest rates are actually
harming economic activity.  Proponents of this view argue evidence of this damage can
be found by looking at how public companies are not spending money on new projects
(capital expenditures) that will foster new growth.  Instead, public companies are using
their profits to buy back company shares which creates little long-term economic value.

So, is there a correlation between zero based interest rates and public company investment
levels in new capitial expenditures vs share buybacks?  My hypothesis will be that there is 
such a correlation and also seek to determine whether these are key indicators or not.
