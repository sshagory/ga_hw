Question 1:

As the file name suggests the data is in tabular format so it's stored in a based db or spreadsheet manner.  So,the column values are separated by a tab.  In terms of their meaning I would say they represent separate values by header classification with supervised, descriptive elements.

Question 2:

By typing 'tail chiptole.tsv' one can see there are 1834 orders based on the 1st column.  Some order numbers have several items.  Some don't.

Question 3:

By catting the file and then issuing wc -l there are  4623 lines listed.

Question 4:

The Chicken Burrito is more popular over the Steak Burrito:  553 to 368. I issued two grep commands to find the answer

a.  grep -i "chicken burrito" chipotle.tsv|wc -l
b.  grep -i "steak burrito" chipotle.tsv |wc -l

I wasn't aware of the 'c' option until looking at the solutions.  Will add this to my toolkit for work.  

Question 5:

Black beans are more popular than pinto beasn in a chicken burrito:  282 to 105.  I issued two grep commands to find the answer:

a.  cat chipotle.tsv |grep -i "chicken burrito" |grep -i "black beans" | wc -l
b.  cat chipotle.tsv |grep -i "chicken burrito" |grep -i "pinto beans"|wc -l

Played with the 'c' option but didn't quite get it right.  Had to look at the answer.

Question 6:

I issued:  ls -ltr *sv

Question 7:

I used 'find -iname *dictionary*' (where i neutralizes the case) but came up with no files in DAT-10.  I checked manually but didn't find any. Looks like
DAT8 had some.

Question 8:

I'm not sure if this qualifies as interesting but I decided to compare the head and tail orders.  Coincidently, there are the same number of total orders.  But the last set of orders had higher comparative price points.
